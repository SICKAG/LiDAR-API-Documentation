# TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol used to establish and maintain connections between devices on a network. It is responsible for ensuring that data is transmitted reliably and in the correct order, by using a system of acknowledgements and retransmissions.

# UDP
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol used for communication in a computer network. It is a connectionless protocol, meaning that it does not establish a dedicated connection before sending data, unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). This makes UDP faster and more efficient, but also less reliable because there is no built-in mechanism for error checking and retransmission of lost packets.

# HTTP
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet. It is the foundation of the web, and is used by browsers to request and receive information from web servers. HTTP defines a set of request methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which are used to indicate the desired action to be performed on a specified resource.

# REST
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for building web services. It is based on the principles of HTTP and is designed to work with the existing infrastructure of the web. RESTful web services use HTTP methods to indicate the desired action to be performed on a specified resource, and return data in a format that can be easily consumed by a client, such as JSON or XML.

# OpenAPI
OpenAPI is a specification for building RESTful web services. It is used to describe the structure and behavior of an API (Application Programming Interface), including the available endpoints, the request and response formats, and the authentication methods. OpenAPI is a machine-readable format, which means that tools can be used to generate client libraries, documentation, and other artifacts based on the specification. This makes it easy for developers to understand and interact with an API, and also helps ensure consistency across different implementations.
